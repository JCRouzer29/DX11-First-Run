Not having one will definitely make this exam significantly more tedious, but NOT impossible!

If your OBJ loader isn't working, that doesn't mean you have to give up!

Free Off-The-Shelf tools exist that may provide an avenue for you to get OBJ files into your code.

While this is nowhere near as nice as having your own working OBJ loader, it at least gives you a fighting chance!!!
